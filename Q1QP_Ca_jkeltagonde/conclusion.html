                <p>Asia’s wildlife is beautiful. Our animals are unique and interesting, but we cannot deny 
                    that most of them are also in danger. The data we've collected serves as evidence of the 
                    significant threats already faced by Asian wildlife. Majority of them are already 
                    vulnerable, and the number of critically endangered animals are getting concerningly 
                    high as well. While there are animals with populations over a million, there are also a 
                    few of them who are now only less than a thousand. 
                    <br><br>
                    Our research is a call for attention for the concerning status of most of our wild animals 
                    in Asia. Lots of the animals that we picked already have risky populations and 
                    conservation status. How much more if we covered the entirety of Asia?
                    <br><br>
                    Let this serve as a reminder that our environment and the organisms living in it are 
                    constantly facing danger. We hope that by reading our research, you can help lessen the 
                    risk of these animals’ lives. Throwing our trash properly can already be a great form of 
                    help for the animals to live in a healthier environment. As scholars who look forward on 
                    what the future has to bring, we want to help preserve and take care of our wildlife. And 
                    with that, we hope that you can join us and become part of the change.
