                <p>Have you ever wondered about the current state of the animals in the wild? Have you 
                    ever been curious to know how many of them are still running around free to enjoy the 
                    wonders of nature? If so, then this Statistics project might just be the one to answer 
                    some of your questions about wildlife.
                    <br><br>
                    Our project aims to educate the viewers about the present conditions of certain wild 
                    animals around Asia. Furthermore, we also talk about some physical characteristics and 
                    other facts about these animals. 
                    All information and data presented in this project are gathered through research from 
                    reliable internet websites. (See References)

                <p> Who:<br>
                    52 various wild animals around the countries of Asia. <br><br>
                    What: <br>
                    These animals’ current status and conditions as well as one of their physical attributes 
                    (weight).<br><br>
                    Where: <br>
                    Asia<br><br>
                    When:<br>
                    Data gathered regarding these animals are from the past 5 years. Mostly from years 
                    2023-2020.<br><br>
                    Why:<br>
                    To give the audience more of an idea about how our wildlife in Asia is doing. Acquiring 
                    insight towards their certain attributes and present circumstances and status will help us 
                    appreciate and understand our environment better. By sharing our knowledge about 
                    these wild animals in Asia, we aim to enlighten the viewers about valuing nature and 
                    becoming responsible scholars who act in preserving and protecting our environment 
                    including the animals that inhabit it. <br><br>
                    How:<br>
                    We researched about the various wild animals of Asia and used their characteristics as 
                    our variables for our Dataset.

            <div class="content" id="eu"><h3>Experimental Unit</h3>
                <p>The Wild animals of Asia are a sample or a subset of a population. There are over 7,819
                    species of wild animals in Asia, but we only picked a certain number of individuals out of 
                    all of them. Our sample size is 52 but our target population was a mix of at least 50 of 
                    the most famous and not very well-known animals in Asia. The data was gathered from 2 
                    websites consisting of a list of the most well-known and not-so-well-known animals in 
                    Asia.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="content" id="vars"><h3>Variables</h3>
                <p>Qualitative: <br>
                    For our qualitative variables, we have the location where the animal is mostly found in
                    (Asian countries only), and the animals’ conservation status. Both qualitative variables 
                    are Nominal.<br><br>
                    Quantitative: <br>
                    For our Quantitative variables, we included their population and weight. There is no unit 
                    of measurement for the population, but for the weight its unit of measurement is in 
                    kilograms or kg.
